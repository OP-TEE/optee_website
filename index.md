# Welcome to OP-TEE

The optee_os git, contains the source code for the TEE in Linux using the ARM® TrustZone® technology. This component meets the GlobalPlatform TEE System Architecture specification. It also provides the TEE Internal core API v1.1 as defined by the GlobalPlatform TEE Standard for the development of Trusted Applications. For a general overview of OP-TEE and to find out how to contribute, please see the Notice.md file.

The Trusted OS is accessible from the Rich OS (Linux or [VxWorks®](https://www.windriver.com/products/vxworks/) ) using the GlobalPlatform TEE Client API Specification v1.0, which also is used to trigger secure execution of applications within the TEE.
