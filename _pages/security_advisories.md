Since June 2021, the content of this security advisories page has been moved to
the OP-TEE GitHub Security Advisories pages [1]. OP-TEE is part of
TrustedFirmware.org and therefore follows the security incident process from
TrustedFirmware.org [2] (you'll find the same link in the OP-TEE documentation
as well).
